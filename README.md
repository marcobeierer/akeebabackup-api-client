# Akeeba Backup API Client
This is a client for the Akeeba Backup API written in Go (golang). It provides just a limited set of API calls but could easily be extended.

## Deprecated
Please note that this project is deprecated, but fully functional as of September 2016. So it could be used as a starting point for further development. I have deloped it for production use, but never used it because I recognized during the development that the API did not provide the level of security I needed for the project.

## Usage
Please see the file **create_backup_task_test.go** for an usage example.

## TODO
- check if file already exists
- set download path
- handle "authentication failed"
